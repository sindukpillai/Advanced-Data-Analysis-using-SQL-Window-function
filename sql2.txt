1. Query to rank restaurants based on the number of food items they offer using a window function:

2.Using ranking functions to find the top 3 food items (based on the quantity ordered) for each restaurant:
WITH RankedFoodItems AS (
    SELECT 
        restaurant_id,
        item_name,
        quantity_ordered,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY restaurant_id ORDER BY quantity_ordered DESC) AS item_rank
    FROM orders
)
SELECT 
    restaurant_id,
    item_name,
    quantity_ordered
FROM RankedFoodItems
WHERE item_rank <= 3;

3.Classifying customers into different categories (like "low", "medium", and "high") based on the total amount they've spent on orders using the CASE statement:
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_price) AS total_spent,
    CASE 
        WHEN SUM(total_price) <= 100 THEN 'low'
        WHEN SUM(total_price) <= 500 THEN 'medium'
        ELSE 'high'
    END AS spending_category
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

4. Classifying orders based on delivery time: "fast" if the delivery time is less than 30 minutes, "medium" if it's between 30 minutes and 1 hour, and "slow" if it's more than 1 hour. Then find the number of deliveries that come under “fast” category:
SELECT 
    order_id,
    delivery_time,
    CASE 
        WHEN delivery_time < '00:30:00' THEN 'fast'
        WHEN delivery_time <= '01:00:00' THEN 'medium'
        ELSE 'slow'
    END AS delivery_category
FROM orders
WHERE delivery_time IS NOT NULL AND delivery_time < '01:00:00' AND delivery_time >= '00:00:00';
